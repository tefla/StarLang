## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create initial 3D ship level with in-world terminals, displays, and environmental storytelling for the first puzzle (Puzzle 1: Broken Switch).

**Note**: Per design update, no tutorials or hints are used. The puzzle itself teaches mechanics through necessity. See docs/game/03-puzzles.md.
